This is my personal guide. I recommend that you read the official [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide). The purpose of this guide is to speed up my personal install of `Archlinux`.

## Why Archlinux
The `Archlinux` distribution gives you the freedom to `do it yourself`. 

__NOTE__ that your kernel and initramfs are on the root file system, recovery after a crash may prove troublesome. 

They are many ways you can layout your partitions, I will focus on:

1. Type of hardware (*BIOS*)

2. The bootloader (*GRUB*)

3. I use my laptop for technical work, so the order,the type and the size of partitions matter for my use case.

4. I am just a speed enthusiast, I like High Performance Computing and why not try to learn by doing it!

The __MAIN__ reason of installing vanilla linux(`Archlinux`) are:

  + __No Bloatware__ - Imagine `4GB` image for Windows, `2GB+` for Fedora or Ubuntu but Arch Linux approx. `700MB`. Softwares preinstalled that you will never use. 
  + __Performance & Security__ - Other distributions contain spyware you didn't install and are working in the background slowing your machine and making you quite uncomfortable.
  + __Learning__ - A better understanding of Linux.
  + __Minimalism__ - Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)

## Pre-installation

Before installing, make sure to:

+ Read the [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide). It is advisable to read that instead. I wrote this guide for myself
+ Acquire an installation image from [here](https://www.archlinux.org/download).
+ Verify signature.
+ Prepare an installation medium.
+ Boot the live environment.
+ Basic understanding of [Vim](https://www.openvim.com/).

## Create an Installation Medium
First we need to create an installation medium to boot from:

On Linux using the `dd` command:

``````
dd if=path_to_arch_iso of=/dev/sd* status=progress
``````
   + `dd` CLI utility for converting and copying files.
   + `if` the input file
   + `of` the output file
   + `progress` see periodic transfer statistics. 

---

# Installation Medium Boot
## Change Font Settings
If the terminal font is too small, which can happen if you have a high resolution display, then execute the following command:

Set the font size to: 

``````
setfont lat4a-19 -m 8859-2
``````

## Connect to the internet

We need to make sure that we are connected to the internet to be able to install Arch Linux `base` and `linux` packages. Let’s see the names of our interfaces.

```
ip addr
```

You should see something like this:

```
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
		link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eno1: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
		link/ether 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: wlo1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
		link/ether 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff permaddr 00:00:00:00:00:00
```

+ `eno1` is the wired interface. 
+ `wlo1` is the wireless interface.  

### Wired Connection

If you are on a wired connection, you can enable your wired interface by systemctl start `dhcpcd@<interface>`.  

```
systemctl start dhcpcd@eno1
```

### Wireless Connection

If you are on a laptop, you can connect to a wireless access point using `iwctl` command from `iwd`. Note that it's already enabled by default. Also make sure the wireless card is not blocked with `rfkill`.

To show current status: 
``````
rfkill list
``````
If the card is hard-blocked, use the hardware button (switch) to unblock it. If the card is not hard-blocked but soft-blocked, use the following command:
``````
rfkill unblock wifi
``````

Scan for network.

```
iwctl station wlo1 scan
```

Get the list of scanned networks by:

```
iwctl station wlo1 get-networks
```

Connect to your network.

```
iwctl -P "PASSPHRASE" station wlo1 connect "NETWORKNAME"
```

Ping the Goggle DNS servers to make sure we are online:

```
ping -c 5 8.8.8.8
``` 

+ `-c 5`    number of times to ping.
+ `8.8.8.8` Google DNS server.

If you receive Unknown host or Destination host unreachable response, means you are not online yet. Review your network configuration and redo the steps above.

## Update the system clock

Use `timedatectl` to ensure the system clock is accurate:

```
timedatectl set-ntp true
```

To check the service status, use `timedatectl status`.

## Partition the disks

When recognized by the live system, disks are assigned to a block device such as `/dev/sda`, `/dev/nvme0n1` or `/dev/mmcblk0`. To identify these devices, use lsblk or fdisk.  The most common main drive is `sda`.

```
lsblk
```

Results ending in `rom`, `loop` or `airoot` may be ignored.

In this guide, I'll create a one type of partition for the drive. A normal installation that is unencrypted:

### Unencrypted filesystem

**NOTE THE FOLLOWING STEPS WILL COMPLETELY FORMAT YOUR DISK NODES. ENSURE YOU'VE READ THE WIKI AND UNDERSTAND THE STEPS BELOW BEFORE EXECUTION**

+ Let’s clean up our main drive to create new partitions for our installation. And yeah, in this guide, we will use `/dev/sda` as our disk.

```
fdisk /dev/sda 
```

+ Press <kbd>p</kbd> to list all partitions. 

   Now we should be presented with our main drive showing the partition number, partition size, partition type, and partition name.

+ Press <kbd>d</kbd> to **delete a partition**.

   Input the number of the partition you want deleted. <kbd>1</kbd> or <kbd>2</kbd>
   
+ Press <kbd>w</kbd> to write changes to the disk. 

   Note that this will ***format*** your entire drive so your data will be gone. **THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE**.

+ Press <kbd>p</kbd> to list all partitions. 

	Now we should be presented with our main drive showing the partition number, partition size, partition type, and partition name.

---

+ Create the `swap` partition

	- Enter <kbd>n</kbd> to create a new partition for the swap.
	- Enter <kbd>p</kbd> to select `primary` partition for the swap.
	- Just hit enter to select the default option for the first sector.
	- For the last sector I always assign mine to <kbd>+8G</kbd>.
	- Enter <kbd>t</kbd> to change the partition.
	- Enter <kbd>82</kbd> to change partition to `Linux swap / Solaris`.

### Size of Swap Partition. 

|RAM Installed|Swap Space|Swap Space With Hibernation|
|-------------|----------|---------------------------|
|Less than 2GB| 2X RAM | 3X RAM|
| 2GB - 8GB | =RAM | 2X RAM |
| 8GB - 64GB | 4G to 0.5X RAM | 1.5X RAM |
| >64GB | Minimum 4GB | Hibernation not recommended |

---

+ Create the `root` partition

	- Enter <kbd>n</kbd> to create a new root partition.
	- Enter <kbd>p</kbd> to select `primary` for the root partition.
	- Hit enter to select the default option for the first sector.
	- Hit enter to select last sector and input your size for the root partition. <kbd>+150G</kbd>. 
	- Enter <kbd>t</kbd> to change the partition.
	- Enter <kbd>83</kbd> to change partition to `Linux`.
---

+ Create the `home` partition

	- Enter <kbd>n</kbd> to create a new home partition.
	- Enter <kbd>p</kbd> to select `primary` for the home partition.
	- Hit enter to select the default option for the first sector.
	- Hit enter again to use the remainder of the disk.
	- Enter <kbd>t</kbd> to change the partition.
	- Enter <kbd>83</kbd> to change partition to `Linux`.

---

+ Lastly write changes to disk `/dev/sda`


	- Enter <kbd>w</kbd> to write all changes to the disk.
	- Enter <kbd>q</kbd> to quit `fdisk` utility.

## Verifying the partitions

Use `lsblk` again to check the partitions we created. 

```
lsblk
```

You should see *something like this*:

### Unencrypted filesystem

| NAME | MAJ:MIN | RM | SIZE | RO | TYPE | MOUNTPOINT |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sda | 8:0 | 0 | 447.1G | 0 |   |   |
| sda1 | 8:1 | 0 | 8G | 0 | part |   |
| sda2 | 8:2 | 0 | 150G | 0 | part |   |
| sda3 | 8:3 | 0 | 289G | 0 | part |   |

**`sda`** is the main disk  
**`sda1`** is the swap partition  
**`sda2`** is the root partition  
**`sda3`** is the home partition

## Format the partitions

### Unencrypted filesystem

+ Create and enable our `swap` under the `/dev/sda1` partition.

```
mkswap /dev/sda1
swapon /dev/sda1
```

+ Format `/dev/sda2` and `/dev/sda3` partition as `BTRFS`. This will be our `root` and `home`  partition.

```
mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda2
mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda3
```

## Mount the filesystems

### Unencryped partition

+ Mount the `/dev/sda1` partition to `/mnt`. This is our `/`:

```
mount -o noatime,space_cache=v2,compress=zstd /dev/sda2 /mnt
```

+ Create a `/home` mountpoint:

```
mkdir /mnt/home  
```

+ Mount `/dev/sda3` to `/mnt/home` partition. This is will be our `/home`:

```
mount -o noatime,space_cache=v2,compress=zstd /dev/sda3 /mnt/home
```

###### Btrfs Options:

   - `-o` add mount options
   - `noatime` Do not update inode access times on this filesystem. This speeds up reads since the access time metadata is not updated. 
   - `space_cache=v2` Options to control the free space cache. The free space cache greatly improves performance when reading block group free space into memory.
   - `compress=zstd` Control BTRFS file data compression. (zstd) for higher compression ratios.

You can read more about btrfs mount options <a href="https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/btrfs-man5.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

+ We don’t need to mount `swap` since it is already enabled.

---

The final result of `lsblk` should be something like this:

  | NAME | MAJ:MIN | RM | SIZE | RO | TYPE | MOUNTPOINT |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | sda | 8:0 | 0 | 447.1G | 0 | disk  |   |
  | sda1 | 8:1 | 0 | 8G | 0 | part | swap   |
  | sda2 | 8:2 | 0 | 150G | 0 | part | /  |
  | sda3 | 8:3 | 0 | 289G | 0 | part | /home  |

---

## Installation

Now let’s go ahead and install `base`, `linux`, `linux-firmware`, and `base-devel` packages into our system.

Ensure you have installed `reflector` and `archlinux-keyring` before procedding with pacstrap installation. 

```
pacman -S reflector archlinux-keyring
```

```
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware vim amd-ucode btrfs-progs
```

+ pacstrap will install the packages mentioned above on a newly made root partition:
   
   - `base`: Base linux system.
   - `linux`: Latest linux kernel and modules.
   - `linux-firmware`: Firmware files for linux.
   - `vim`: Terminal based text editor.
   - `intel-ucode`: Microcode update files for Intel CPUs.
   - `amd-ucode`: Microde update files for AMD CPUs.
   - `btrfs-progress`: Brtfs filesystem utilites.
<br></br>

+ Other kernel available for installation are:
   - `linux-lts`: Long term support of the Linux Kernel.
   - `linux-zen`: For the performance driven users.
   - `linux-hardened`: For the security concerned users.

Users interested in installing other kernels on the system read this [post](https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/btrfs-man5.html).  

The `base` package does not include all tools from the live installation, so installing other packages may be necessary for a fully functional base system. In particular, consider installing: 

+ userspace utilities for the management of file systems that will be used on the system,
	
   - `ntfs-3g`: NTFS filesystem driver and utilities
   - `unrar`: The RAR uncompression program
   - `unzip`: For extracting and viewing files in `.zip` archives
   - `p7zip`: Command-line file archiver with high compression ratio
   - `unarchiver`: `unar` and `lsar`: Objective-C tools for uncompressing archive files
   - `gvfs-mtp`: Virtual filesystem implementation for `GIO` (`MTP` backend; Android, media player)
   - `libmtp`: Library implementation of the Media Transfer Protocol
   - `android-udev`: Udev rules to connect Android devices to your linux box
   - `mtpfs`: A FUSE filesystem that supports reading and writing from any MTP devic
   - `xdg-user-dirs`: Manage user directories like `~/Desktop` and `~/Music`
<br></br>

+ software necessary for networking,

   - `dhcpcd`: RFC2131 compliant DHCP client daemon
   - `iwd`: Internet Wireless Daemon
   - `inetutils`: A collection of common network programs
   - `iputils`: Network monitoring tools, including `ping`
<br></br>

+ packages for accessing documentation in man and info pages,

	- `man-db`
	- `man-pages`
<br></br>

+ and more useful tools:

   - `git`: the fast distributed version control system
   - `tmux`: A terminal multiplexer
   - `less`: A terminal based program for viewing text files
   - `usbutils`: USB Device Utilities
   - `bash-completion`: Programmable completion for the bash shell
   - `exa`: CLI utility for listing files. Modern day replacement for `ls`

These tools will be useful later.

## Generating the fstab

```
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

Check the resulting `/mnt/etc/fstab` file, and edit it in case of errors.

``````
cat /mnt/etc/fstab
``````

## Chroot

Now, change root into the newly installed system  

```
arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash
```

## Time zone

A selection of timezones can be found under `/usr/share/zoneinfo/`. Since I am in the Kenya, I will be using `/usr/share/zoneinfo/Africa/Nairobi`. Select the appropriate timezone for your country:

Create a symolic link to `etc/localtime`

```
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Africa/Nairobi /etc/localtime
```

Run `hwclock` to generate `/etc/adjtime`: 

```
hwclock --systohc
```

This command assumes the hardware clock is set to UTC.

## Localization

The `locale` defines which language the system uses, and other regional considerations such as currency denomination, numerology, and character sets. Possible values are listed in `/etc/locale.gen`. Uncomment `en_US.UTF-8`, as well as other needed localisations.

``````
vim /etc/locale.gen
``````

**Uncomment** `en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8` in `/etc/locale.gen`, **save** the file, and generate them with:  

or use the command to uncomment the line:

``````
sed -i `178s` /etc/locale.gen
``````
generate the `locale.gen` file:

```
locale-gen
```

Create the `locale.conf` file, and set the LANG variable accordingly:  

```
echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" >> /etc/locale.conf
```

If you set the keyboard layout earlier, make the changes persistent in `vconsole.conf`:

```
echo "KEYMAP=us" > /etc/vconsole.conf
```

## Network configuration

Create the hostname file. In this guide I'll just use `MYHOSTNAME` as hostname. Hostname is the host name of the host.

```
echo "MYHOSTNAME" > /etc/hostname
```

Open `/etc/hosts` to add matching entries to `hosts`:

```
127.0.0.1    localhost  
::1          localhost  
127.0.1.1    MYHOSTNAME.localdomain	  MYHOSTNAME
```

If the system has a permanent IP address, it should be used instead of `127.0.1.1`.

## Adding btrfs mofule to mkinitcpio

Since we create the formatted the system using btrfs, we need to add the `btrfs` module to the kernel inorder to initalized it at boot.

Edit the mkinitcpio configuration file:

``````
vim /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
``````

Add `btrfs` to the modules section.

``````
MODULES=(btrfs)
``````

### Unencrypted filesystem

Generate the `mkinitcpio` 

``````
mkinitcpio -p linux
``````

## Adding Repositories - multilib and AUR

Enable multilib and AUR repositories in `/etc/pacman.conf`. Open it with your editor of choice:

### Adding multilib repository

Uncomment `multilib` (remove # from the beginning of the lines). It should look like this:  

```
[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

### Adding the AUR repository

Add the following lines at the end of your `/etc/pacman.conf` to enable the AUR repo:  

```
[archlinuxfr]
SigLevel = Never
Server = http://repo.archlinux.fr/$arch
```

### Pacman easter eggs

You can enable the "easter-eggs" in `pacman`, the package manager of archlinux.

Open `/etc/pacman.conf`, then find `# Misc options`. 

To add colors to `pacman`, uncomment `Color`. To add the "Pac-Man" animation to `pacman` add the following command: `ILoveCandy` under the `Color` string:

```
Color
ILoveCandy
```

### Update repositories and packages

To check if you successfully added the repositories and enable the easter-eggs, run:

```
pacman -Syu
```

If updating returns an error, open the `pacman.conf` again and check for human errors. Yes, you f'ed up big time.

### Install packages

```
pacman -S grub efibootmgr os-prober ntfs-3g \
networkmanager network-manager-applet wireless_tools \
wpa_supplicant dialog mtools dosfstools base-devel \
linux-headers alsa-utils openssh 
```

### Installing GRUB

Installing grub on a legacy system:

``````
grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda 
``````

Installing grub on a UEFI system:

``````
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/ --bootloader-id=GRUB
``````
Genertate the configuration file:

``````
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
``````

## Root password

Set the `root` password:  

```
passwd
```
Enter your password twice to set the root password. 

## Add a user account

Add a new user account. In this guide, I'll just use `MYUSERNAME` as the username of the new user aside from `root` account. Of course, change the example username with your own:  

```
useradd -m -g users -G wheel,storage,power,video,audio,rfkill,input -s /bin/bash MYUSERNAME
```

This will create a new user and its `home` folder.

Set the password of user `MYUSERNAME`:  

```
passwd MYUSERNAME
```

## Add the new user to sudoers:

If you want a root privilege in the future by using the `sudo` command, you should grant one yourself:

```
EDITOR=vim visudo
```

Uncomment the line (Remove #):

```
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

## Enable internet connection for the next boot

To enable the network daemons on your next reboot, you need to enable `dhcpcd.service` for wired connection and `iwd.service` for a wireless one.

```
systemctl enable dhcpcd iwd
```

## Exit chroot and reboot:  

Exit the chroot environment by typing `exit`.

Unmount all partitions with the following command: 

``````
umount -R /mnt
``````

Finally, `reboot`.

``````
reboot
``````
