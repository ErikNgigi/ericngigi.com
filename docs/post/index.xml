      <description>&lt;p&gt;Practice exams are an essential component of any effective certification preparation strategy, and the AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) Practice Exams Questions are designed to help candidates evaluate their proficiency in AWS cloud computing. In this article summary, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the significance of practice exams and how they can benefit aspiring AWS Cloud Practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing Knowledge&lt;/strong&gt;: The CLF-C01 certification covers a wide range of AWS services and concepts, including cloud computing fundamentals, AWS services and their use cases, billing and pricing models, and AWS security best practices. Practice exams offer candidates an opportunity to assess their knowledge across these areas. They help individuals identify their strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to focus their study efforts more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exam Simulation&lt;/strong&gt;: The AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) Practice Exams Questions aim to replicate the format and difficulty level of the actual certification exam. By taking these practice exams, candidates can experience the test environment, including time constraints and question types, before the real exam. This simulation helps reduce exam anxiety and builds confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identifying Knowledge Gaps&lt;/strong&gt;: As candidates progress through the practice exams, they receive immediate feedback on their answers. This feedback not only tells them whether they answered correctly but also provides explanations and references to AWS documentation. It&amp;rsquo;s an invaluable resource for closing knowledge gaps and gaining a deeper understanding of the AWS platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Management&lt;/strong&gt;: Time management is crucial during the CLF-C01 exam. Practice exams help candidates practice pacing themselves and managing their time effectively. By repeatedly taking these exams, candidates can refine their time management skills, ensuring they complete the real certification test within the allocated time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adaptive Learning&lt;/strong&gt;: Some practice exam platforms offer adaptive learning features, tailoring subsequent questions based on a candidate&amp;rsquo;s performance. This personalized approach ensures candidates spend more time on their weaker areas, ultimately enhancing their overall preparedness for the CLF-C01 exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confidence Building&lt;/strong&gt;: Confidence is a key factor in exam success. The more practice exams a candidate completes and performs well on, the more confident they become. This increased confidence can have a positive impact on their actual exam performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, practice exams play a vital role in helping candidates prepare for the AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C01) certification. They serve as a reliable self-assessment tool, simulate the exam environment, and assist in identifying and addressing knowledge gaps. Aspiring AWS Cloud Practitioners should consider incorporating practice exams into their study plan to increase their chances of passing the CLF-C01 exam and launching a successful career in cloud computing with AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Essential Cloud Computing Concepts for AWS Beginners</title>
      <link>/post/aws/cloud-computing-concepts/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/aws/cloud-computing-concepts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing has become an integral part of the modern IT landscape, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) stands as a prominent player in the cloud services industry. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re considering a career in AWS or looking to enhance your cloud computing knowledge, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to grasp certain fundamental concepts before diving into AWS. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss why learning about internet and networking, command line interfaces (CLIs), and virtualization is essential as you embark on your AWS career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/post/aws/networking-image.webp&#34; alt=&#34;networking-basics&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;internet-and-networking&#34;&gt;Internet and Networking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before delving into AWS, understanding internet and networking concepts is paramount for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connectivity&lt;/strong&gt;: AWS services are accessible over the internet, and a solid understanding of how data travels across networks is essential. Learning about protocols, IP addressing, subnets, and routing will help you configure and troubleshoot network components within AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;: Network security is a top priority in AWS. Without a grasp of networking fundamentals, you may struggle to set up firewalls, security groups, and network access controls effectively. Properly securing your AWS resources relies on a sound knowledge of networking principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bandwidth and Latency&lt;/strong&gt;: AWS offers various network-related services like Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and AWS Direct Connect. Understanding concepts such as bandwidth, latency, and data transfer costs will help you make informed decisions about network architecture and resource placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hybrid Cloud Environments&lt;/strong&gt;: Many organizations use AWS in conjunction with on-premises infrastructure. Knowledge of networking ensures you can seamlessly integrate your AWS resources with existing systems through technologies like VPNs and Direct Connect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/post/aws/ubuntu-command-line.webp&#34; alt=&#34;command-line-basics&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;command-line-interfaces-clis&#34;&gt;Command Line Interfaces (CLIs):&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS provides both web-based and command line interfaces for managing resources. Learning the CLI, such as the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), is crucial for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;: Using the CLI can be more efficient than navigating the AWS Management Console for repetitive tasks. Automation and scripting become much more accessible with CLI expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/strong&gt;: When issues arise, having CLI skills allows you to investigate and resolve problems quickly. You can retrieve detailed logs and run diagnostic commands directly from the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability and Automation&lt;/strong&gt;: As your AWS projects grow, automating deployments and management tasks becomes essential. CLI proficiency is a stepping stone to infrastructure as code (IAC) tools like AWS CloudFormation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;: Different AWS services provide CLI support, making it a versatile tool for managing diverse resources, from EC2 instances to S3 buckets and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/post/aws/virtualization-image.webp&#34; alt=&#34;server-virtualization&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;virtualization&#34;&gt;Virtualization:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtualization forms the foundation of cloud computing and AWS. Understanding virtualization is vital because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Allocation&lt;/strong&gt;: AWS instances run on virtualized hardware. Knowing how virtualization works enables you to optimize resource allocation, such as CPU, memory, and storage, for your workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolation&lt;/strong&gt;: Virtualization provides the isolation required to run multiple workloads securely on shared physical infrastructure. This is critical for maintaining data integrity and security in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elasticity&lt;/strong&gt;: AWS&amp;rsquo;s ability to scale resources up or down relies on virtualization technology. Understanding this allows you to leverage AWS&amp;rsquo;s elasticity effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Migration&lt;/strong&gt;: Migrating existing on-premises systems to AWS often involves converting physical servers to virtual instances. Knowledge of virtualization helps with this transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Networking Fundamentals</title>
      <link>/post/networking/understanding-ipv4/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;understanding-ipv4-and-the-basics-of-ipv4-addresses&#34;&gt;Understanding IPv4 and the Basics of IPv4 Addresses&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of networking, the Internet Protocol (IP) is the backbone that enables devices to communicate and share data across the global network. One of the most well-known versions of the IP is IPv4, which stands for Internet Protocol Version 4. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore what IPv4 is and delve into the fundamentals of IPv4 addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ipv4-address-the-digital-identifiers&#34;&gt;IPv4 Address: The Digital Identifiers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cornerstone of IPv4 is the IP address, a 32-bit numerical label that uniquely identifies a device on a network. IPv4 addresses are typically written in a format known as &amp;ldquo;dotted-decimal notation,&amp;rdquo; where four octets (sets of 8 bits) are separated by periods (dots). For example, an IPv4 address might look like &amp;ldquo;192.168.1.1.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;32-bit Addressing&lt;/strong&gt;: IPv4 addresses consist of 32 bits, divided into four octets. Each octet can represent a value from 0 to 255, making a total of over four billion unique IPv4 addresses possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network and Host Identification&lt;/strong&gt;: In an IPv4 address, the first part (the leftmost octets) identifies the network, while the last part (the rightmost octet) identifies the specific device, or host, within that network. This separation is crucial for routing data across the internet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address Classes&lt;/strong&gt;: IPv4 addresses are categorized into five classes—A, B, C, D, and E—based on the range of values in the first octet. Each class has its own characteristics, address ranges, and default subnet masks, tailored to different network sizes and requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subnetting&lt;/strong&gt;: IPv4 supports subnetting, a technique that allows network administrators to divide a larger IP address range into smaller subnetworks. Subnetting enhances network management, security, and efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ipv4-address-format&#34;&gt;IPv4 Address Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPv4 addresses are represented as four decimal numbers separated by dots, a format commonly referred to as &amp;lsquo;dotted decimal.&amp;rsquo; Each of these four numbers is termed an &amp;lsquo;octet&amp;rsquo; due to its composition of 8 bits. Below, you can see the binary representation of each octet in the IPv4 address 192.168.10.100:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Format&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;1st Octet&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;2nd Octet&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;3rd Octet&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;4th Octet&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dotted Decimal&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;192&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;168&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Binary&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;11000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10101000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;00001010&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;01100100&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An octet can contain values ranging from 0 to 255, resulting in the entire IPv4 address space spanning from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. Within an IPv4 address, there are distinct segments: the network portion and the host portion. To identify these sections, a subnet mask is employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;network-address&#34;&gt;Network Address&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network part of the IPv4 address is on the left-hand side of the IP address. It specifies the particular network to where the IPv4 address belongs. The network portion of the address also identifies the IP address class of the IPv4 address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we have the IPv4 address 192.168.10.100 and a /24 subnet mask. /24 simply means that the first 24 bits, starting from the left side, is the network portion of the IPv4 address. The 8 remaining bits of the 32 bits will be the host portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;host-address&#34;&gt;Host Address&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The host portion of the IPv4 address uniquely identifies the device or the interface on your network. Hosts that have the same network portion can communicate with one another directly, without the need for the traffic to be routed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;converting-the-decimal-ip-address-to-binary&#34;&gt;Converting the Decimal IP Address to Binary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP addresses can be interpreted either in their decimal or binary forms; however, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that network devices exclusively comprehend the binary representation. Therefore, it becomes crucial for us to grasp the process of converting a decimal IP address into its binary equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;decimal-number&#34;&gt;Decimal Number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decimal is a base-10 numbering system that&amp;rsquo;s widely familiar to us. In this system, we employ ten distinct numerals to symbolize numbers ranging from zero to nine. These numerals are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. When we reach the value ten, there is no specific numeral to denote it. Instead, we transition to the next place value, advancing from ones to tens and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;binary-number&#34;&gt;Binary Number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary numbers constitute an alternative numerical system predominantly employed to express machine language. In stark contrast to the decimal system, binary utilizes merely two numerals for representation, namely, 1 and 0. Each placeholder in the binary system possesses a distinct value, which is why it is often referred to as the Base 2 Numbering System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;converting-decimal-to-binary-ip-address&#34;&gt;Converting Decimal to Binary IP Address&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of an IPv4 address in dotted decimal format and its corresponding binary format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Address = 192.168.32.47&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB&lt;/strong&gt;: The 1st Octet of the IPv4 address is used in the calculation below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Division by 2&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Quotient&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Remainder(Digit)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Bit #&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(192)/2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;96&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(96)/2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;48&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(3)/2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;(1)/2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;converting-binary-ip-address-to-decimal&#34;&gt;Converting Binary IP Address to Decimal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of an IPv4 address in binary format and its corresponding dotted decimal format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary format = 11000000&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(11000000)₂ = (1 × 2⁷) + (1 × 2⁶) + (0 × 2⁵) + (0 × 2⁴) + (0 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (0 × 2¹) + (0 × 2⁰) = 192&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer above corresponds to the 1st Octet of the following IP Address(192.168.32.47)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;subnet-mask-explained&#34;&gt;Subnet Mask Explained&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An IP address is typically split into two distinct components: the network part and the host part. Take, for instance, a Class A IP address, where 8 bits are dedicated to identifying the network, leaving the remaining 24 bits to identify the host. This allocation aligns with the default subnet mask for a Class A IP address, which is 8 bits in length and is expressed in dotted decimal notation as 255.0.0.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To comprehend this concept further, it&amp;rsquo;s important to recognize that both an IP address and a subnet mask consist of 32 bits in total. Computers employ the subnet mask to differentiate between the network and host portions of an address. In this context, the &amp;lsquo;1s&amp;rsquo; in the subnet mask denote the network segment, while the &amp;lsquo;0s&amp;rsquo; represent the host portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;slash-notation&#34;&gt;Slash Notation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the familiar dotted decimal format, subnet masks can also be represented using slash notation. This notation consists of a forward slash (&amp;rsquo;/&amp;rsquo;) followed by the number of subnet mask bits. To determine the slash notation for a subnet mask, first, convert the dotted decimal format into binary, then count the consecutive &amp;lsquo;1s&amp;rsquo; in the binary representation, and finally, add the slash notation at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, consider the dotted decimal subnet mask of 255.0.0.0. When expressed in binary, it becomes 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000. By counting the consecutive &amp;lsquo;1s,&amp;rsquo; which in this case are 8, we can determine that the slash notation for 255.0.0.0 is /8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Value of the First Octet&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Class&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0 - 127&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;128 - 191&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;192 - 223&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ip-address-classes&#34;&gt;IP Address Classes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCP/IP categorizes IP addresses into five distinct classes: Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, and Class E. The designation of a class is determined by the value of the first octet of the IP address. The first three classes (A, B, and C) encompass IP addresses that can be utilized as host addresses. The remaining two classes, Class D and Class E, serve alternative functions, with Class D designated for multicast purposes and Class E reserved for experimental use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Class A IP addresses, the initial 8 bits (or the first decimal number) are allocated to represent the network segment, leaving the remaining 24 bits to denote the host portion. For Class B addresses, the first 16 bits (or the first two decimal numbers) are designated for the network part, while the subsequent 16 bits serve as the host part. In the case of Class C, the initial 24 bits are reserved to define the network component, while the final 8 bits are utilized for specifying the host segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Class&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Public IP Range&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Network Bits&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Default Subnet Mask&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Slash Notation&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1.0.0.0 - 127.0.0.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255.0.0.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;128.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255.255.0.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/16&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;255.255.255.0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;/24&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;subnetting-explained&#34;&gt;Subnetting Explained&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnetting involves the partitioning of a network into multiple smaller networks, a practice employed to bolster routing efficiency, fortify network security, and diminish the size of broadcast domains. An evident drawback of having all hosts within a single network is the creation of a unified broadcast domain where any broadcast transmission initiated by any device permeates throughout the entire network, leading to a surfeit of unnecessary traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup also introduces security concerns, as every device gains unrestricted access to communicate with any other device on the network. This unrestricted access can pose potential security risks, for instance, having a server housing sensitive information coexist in the same network as user workstations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subnetting also aids in addressing organizational concerns, particularly in extensive networks. In larger networks, different departments or units are often segregated into distinct subnets, streamlining network management and administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;cidr-classless-inter-domain-routing&#34;&gt;CIDR (Classless inter-domain routing)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a method of assigning public IP addresses that was introduced in 1993 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It was devised to address two primary objectives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigating IPv4 Address Exhaustion:&lt;/strong&gt; CIDR was developed in response to the pressing issue of IPv4 address depletion. It sought to optimize IP address allocation in the face of dwindling available addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curbing the Expansion of Internet Routing Tables:&lt;/strong&gt; Another key aim of CIDR was to slow down the proliferation of routing tables within Internet routers. This helped alleviate the strain on the core infrastructure of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the advent of CIDR, public IP address assignment adhered to class-based boundaries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class A:&lt;/strong&gt; The classful subnet mask was /8, offering a total of 16,777,216 possible IP addresses (2 to the power of 24).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class B:&lt;/strong&gt; The classful subnet mask was /16, providing 65,536 addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class C:&lt;/strong&gt; The classful subnet mask was /24, with only 256 addresses available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIDR introduced a more flexible approach to IP address allocation, enabling the allocation of varying block sizes and allowing for a more efficient utilization of the dwindling IPv4 address space. It ushered in a more scalable and sustainable way of managing IP addresses on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;subnet-creation&#34;&gt;Subnet Creation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of methods to create subnets. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll be focusing on subnetting a default Class C address, which is 192.168.0.0, and comes with 24 subnet bits and 8 host bits as per the default configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving into subnetting, it&amp;rsquo;s essential to address two crucial questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining the Number of Subnets Needed:&lt;/strong&gt;
To calculate the number of subnets required, we can employ the formula 2^x, where &amp;lsquo;x&amp;rsquo; represents the count of &amp;lsquo;1s&amp;rsquo; in the subnet mask. For instance, with just one subnet bit, we can generate 2^1, or 2 subnets. By extending this logic, using 2 bits yields 2^2, or 4 subnets, while 3 bits provide 2^3, or 8 subnets, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining the Hosts per Subnet:&lt;/strong&gt;
For ascertaining the number of hosts per subnet, we utilize the formula 2^y - 2, where &amp;lsquo;y&amp;rsquo; corresponds to the count of &amp;lsquo;0s&amp;rsquo; in the subnet mask. This calculation excludes two addresses: one for the network address and another for the broadcast address, ensuring that we reserve these addresses for network identification and broadcast transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subnetting-example&#34;&gt;Subnetting Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the concept of subnetting, consider the following scenario. Suppose we need to subnet a Class C address, specifically 192.168.0.0/24, into two subnets, each accommodating up to 50 hosts. Here&amp;rsquo;s how we can calculate and implement this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining the Subnet Mask:&lt;/strong&gt;
To create two subnets, we require 2^1, or 2, subnet bits. In our case, this necessitates borrowing one bit from the host portion. Let&amp;rsquo;s convert the Class C address and its default subnet mask to binary form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;192.168.0.0 = 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;255.255.255.0 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking a single &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; from the host part of the subnet mask, we obtain the new subnet mask:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;255.255.255.128 = 11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to remember that the &amp;lsquo;1s&amp;rsquo; in the subnet mask denote the network portion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculating Hosts per Subnet:&lt;/strong&gt;
With one bit allocated for subnetting, we&amp;rsquo;re left with seven bits for hosts. This raises the question: can these seven bits accommodate at least 50 hosts per subnet? To ascertain this, we apply the formula 2^y - 2, where &amp;lsquo;y&amp;rsquo; represents the number of host bits. In this case, 2^7 - 2 equals 126, which is more than sufficient for our requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating the Subnets:&lt;/strong&gt;
Our network now consists of two subnets, structured as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;192.168.0.0/25: The first subnet has a subnet number of 192.168.0.0. The range of IP addresses within this subnet spans from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.127.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;192.168.0.128/25: The second subnet bears a subnet number of 192.168.0.128. The IP addresses in this subnet fall within the range of 192.168.0.128 to 192.168.0.255.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This subnetting approach allows us to efficiently manage our network, dividing it into smaller, manageable segments while ensuring adequate host capacity for each subnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Computing:&lt;/strong&gt; The on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Cloud computing enables you to stop thinking of infrastructure as hardware, and instead think of (and use) it as software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;traditional-computing-model&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional Computing Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure as hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hardware solutions: Require space, staff, physical security, planning, capital expenditure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a long hardware procurement cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Require you to provision capacity by guessing theoretical maximum peaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-computing-model&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Computing Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure as software&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software solutions:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are flexible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can change more quickly, easily, and cost-effectively than hardware solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate the undifferentiated heavy-lifting tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud service models vary on how much control you have over IT resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Most control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platform as a Service (PaaS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software as a Service (SaaS) - Least control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing deployment models&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hybrid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-premse (Private Cloud)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing can do almost anything the traditional IT can do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Service:&lt;/strong&gt; Any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet and uses a standardized format—such as Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) — for the request and the response of an application programming interface (API) interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-aws&#34;&gt;What is AWS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS is a secure cloud platform that offers a broad set of global cloud-based products called services that are designed to work together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are many categories of AWS services, and each category has many services to choose from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose a service based on your business goals and technology requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are three ways to interact with AWS services:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Management Console - Graphical interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command Line Interface (CLI) - Access via discrete commands or scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Development Kits (SDK) - Access directly from code&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1-aws-global-infrastructure&#34;&gt;Section 1: AWS Global Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://infrastructure.aws/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;AWS Global Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;
 is designed and built to deliver a flexible, reliable, scalable, and secure cloud computing environment with high-quality global network performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aws-regions&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An AWS Region is a geographical area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data replication across Regions is controlled by you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication between Regions uses AWS backbone network infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each Region provides full redundancy and connectivity to the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Region typically consists of two or more Availability Zones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When selecting a region consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laws - Data governance and legal requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proximity - Select regions close to your customers for reduced latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability - Some services are region locked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost - Cost varies by region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Availability Zone is a fully isolated partition of the AWS infrastructure. There are currently 69 Availability Zones worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability Zones consist of discrete data centers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are interconnected with other Availability Zones by using high-speed private networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are designed for fault isolation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You choose your Availability Zones but AWS recommends replicating data and resources across Availability Zones for resiliency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aws-data-centers&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Data Centers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS data centers are designed for security. Each data center has redundant power, networking, and connectivity, and is housed in a separate facility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data centers are where the data resides and data processing occurs. A data center typically has 50,000 to 80,000 physical servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS provides a global network of 187 Points of Presence locations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consists of 176 edge locations - where end users access services located at AWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;11 Regional edge caches - cache copies of your infrequent content close to your users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used with &lt;strong&gt;Amazon CloudFront&lt;/strong&gt; -  a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS Infrastructure Features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elasticity and scalability - dynamically adapts to capacity and growth needs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fault-tolerance - Continues operating properly in the presence of a failure due to built-in redundancy of components&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High availability - High operational performance with minimized downtime and no human intervention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-2-identity-and-access-management-iam&#34;&gt;Section 2: Identity and Access Management (IAM)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that enables Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers to manage users and user permissions in AWS. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users can access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) can be used to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage IAM Users and their access:&lt;/strong&gt; You can create Users and assign them individual security credentials (access keys, passwords, and multi-factor authentication devices). You can manage permissions to control which operations a User can perform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage IAM Roles and their permissions:&lt;/strong&gt; An IAM Role is similar to a User, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a Role is intended to be assumableby anyone who needs it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage federated users and their permissions:&lt;/strong&gt; You can enable identity federationto allow existing users in your enterprise to access the AWS Management Console, to call AWS APIs and to access resources, without the need to create an IAM User for each identity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;essential-components&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essential Components&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAM User:&lt;/strong&gt; A person or application that can authenticate with an AWS account. When you define an IAM user, you select what types of access the user is permitted to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programmatic Access
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authenticate using Access Key ID and Secret Access Key&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides AWS CLI and AWS SDK access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Management Console Access
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Authenticate using Account ID or Alias, or Username and Password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAM Group:&lt;/strong&gt; A collection of IAM users that are granted identical authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A user can belong to multiple groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no default group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Groups cannot be nested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAM Policy:&lt;/strong&gt; The document that defines which resources can be accessed and the level of access to each resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permissions determine which resources and operations are allowed.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All permissions are implicitly denied by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If something is explicitly denied, it is never allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two Types of Policies:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identity Based
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attach a policy to any IAM entity - user, group, or role&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policies specify actions that may or may not be performed by the entity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Policies and entities have a many-to-many relationship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the policy is updated, the changes to the policy are immediately apply against all Users and Groups that are attached to the policy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource Based
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attached to a resource (such as an S3 bucket)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specifies who has access to the resource and what actions they can perform on it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The policies are inline only, not managed. An inline policy is assigned to just one User or Group. Inline Policies are typically used to apply permissions for one-off situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resource-based policies are supported only by some AWS services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IAM Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Useful mechanism to grant a set of permissions for making AWS service requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar to an IAM user: Attach permissions policies to it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different from an IAM user: Not uniquely associated with one person, intended to be assumable by a person, application, or service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Role provides temporary security credentials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principle of Least Privilege:&lt;/strong&gt; The practice of limiting access rights for users to the bare minimum permissions they need to perform their work. Under POLP, users are granted permission to read, write or execute only the files or resources they need to do their jobs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3-securing-a-new-aws-account&#34;&gt;Section 3: Securing a New AWS Account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best practice: Do not use the AWS account root user except when necessary. Access to the account root user requires logging in with the email address and password that you used to create the account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop using the account root user as soon as possible
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While you are logged in as the account root user, create an IAM user for yourself. Save the access keys if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an IAM group, give it full administrator permissions, and add the IAM user to the group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable and remove your account root user access keys, if they exist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a password policy for users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sign in with your new IAM user credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use AWS CloudTrail
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CloudTrail tracks user activity on your account. It logs all API requests to resources in all supported services your account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic AWS CloudTrail event history is enabled by defaultand is free. It contains all management event data for the last 90 days of account activity (this can be extended beyon 90 days)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a billing report, such as the &lt;em&gt;AWS Cost and Usage Report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;aws-organizations-1&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Organizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations enable you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts so that you centrally manage them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security Features of AWS Organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group AWS accounts into organizational units (OUs) and attach different access policies to each OU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration and support for IAM. Permissions to a user are the intersection of what is allowed by AWS Organizations and what is granted by IAM in that account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use service control policies to establish control over the AWS services and API actions that each AWS account can access&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;service-control-policies&#34;&gt;Service Control Policies&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service control policies (SCPs) offer centralized control over accounts. Limit permissions that are available in an account that is part of an organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensures that accounts comply with access control guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCPs are similar to IAM permissions policies – They use similar syntax, but an SCP never grants permissions. Instead, SCPs specify the maximum permissions for an organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;key-management-service&#34;&gt;Key Management Service&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enables you to create and manage encryption keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enables you to control the use of encryption across AWS services and in your applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrates with AWS CloudTrail to log all key usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses hardware security modules (HSMs) that are validated by Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 to protect keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;cognito&#34;&gt;Cognito&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adds user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile applications. Scales to millions of users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports sign-in with social identity providers, such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon; and enterprise identity providers, such as Microsoft Active Directory via Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shield&#34;&gt;Shield&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is a managed distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Shield Standard enabled for at no additional cost. AWS Shield Advanced is an optional paid service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use it to minimize application downtime and latency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-5-securing-data&#34;&gt;Section 5: Securing Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-at-rest&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data at Rest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data at rest = Data stored physically (on disk or on tape)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encryption encodes data with a secret key, which makes it unreadable. Only those who have the secret key can decode the data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can encrypt data stored in any service that is supported by AWS KMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;data-in-transit&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data in Transit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data in transit = Data moving across a network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transport Layer Security (TLS) — formerly SSL, is an open standard protocol. AWS Certificate Manager provides a way to manage, deploy, and renew TLS or SSL certificates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secure HTTP (HTTPS) creates a secure tunnel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-6-working-to-ensure-compliance&#34;&gt;Section 6: Working to Ensure Compliance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers are subject to many different security and compliance regulations and requirements. AWS engages with certifying bodies and independent auditors to provide customers with detailed information about the policies, processes, and controls that are established and operated by AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance programs can be broadly categorized:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certifications and attestations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laws, regulations, and privacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alignments and frameworks - Industry or function-specific security or compliance requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aws-config&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Config&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1-networking-basics&#34;&gt;Section 1: Networking Basics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network:&lt;/strong&gt; Two or more machines that are connected together in order to communicate. A network can be divided into subnets and networking requires a networking device such as a router or a switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IP Address:&lt;/strong&gt; A unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network. IPv4 defines an IP address as a 32-bit number, but because of the growth of the Internet IPv6 was created, using 128 bits for the IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR):&lt;/strong&gt; A method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing. CIDR notation is a compact representation of an IP address and its associated routing prefix. The notation is constructed from an IP address, a slash (&amp;rsquo;/&amp;rsquo;) character, and an integer. The integer is the count of leading 1 bits in the subnet mask. Larger values here indicate smaller networks. The maximum size of the network is given by the number of addresses that are possible with the remaining, least-significant bits below the prefix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Example: The IPv4 block 192.168.100.0/22 represents the 1024 IPv4 addresses from 192.168.100.0 to 192.168.103.255.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model:&lt;/strong&gt; A conceptual model that characterises and standardises the communication functions of a computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols. The model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Layer&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Number&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Means for an application to access a computer network&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;HTTP(S), FTP, DHCP, LDAP&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Presentation&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Gives you control over your virtual networking resources, including: Selection of IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Closely resembles a traditional network that you would operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enables you to customize the network configurationfor your VPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enables you to use multiple layers of security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can create a VPC that spans multiple Availability Zones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vpcs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPCs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logically isolated from other VPCs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dedicated to your AWS account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belong to a single AWS Region and can span multiple Availability Zones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you create a VPC, you assign it to an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR block. You cannot change the address range after creation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subnets&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subnets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Range of IP addresses that divide a VPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belong to a single Availability Zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classified as public (has route to the internet) or private (no internet)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CIDR blocks of subnets cannot overlap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each CIDR block has 5 reserved addresses for: network address, internal communication, DNS resolution, future use, and network broadcast address&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;elastic-network-interface&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elastic Network Interface&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address, associated with your AWS account, designed for dynamic cloud computing. You can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance.You can detach from the instance, and attach to another instance to redirect network traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its attributes follow when it is reattached to a new instance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each instance in your VPC has a default network interface that is assigned a private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;routes-and-route-tables&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Routes and Route Tables&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The route table controls routing for the subnet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A route table contains a set of rules (or routes) that you can configure to direct network traffic from your subnet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each route specifies a destination and a target&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default, every route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each subnet must be associated with a single route table&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-3-vpc-networking&#34;&gt;Section 3: VPC Networking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;internet-gateway&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet Gateway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scalable, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the public internet. An internet gateway serves two purposes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a target in your VPC route tables for internet traffic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform network address translation for instances that were assigned public IPv4 addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make a subnet public, you attach an internet gateway to your VPC and add a route entry to the route table associated with the subnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;network-address-translation-nat-gateway&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but it prevents the public internet from initiating a connection with those instances. To create a NAT Gateway you must:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify the public subnet in which the gateway should live.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify an elastic IP address to associate with the NAT Gateway when you create it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you create a NAT Gateway, you must update the route table that is associated with one or more of your private subnets to point internet-bound traffic to the NAT gateway. This allows instances in your private subnets to communicate with the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vpc-sharing&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPC Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enables customers to share subnets with other AWS accounts in the same organization. VPC Sharing enables multiple AWS accounts to create their application resources in a shared, centrally managed VPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The account that owns the VPC shares one or more subnets with other accounts, called participants, that belong to the same organization. After a subnet is shared, participants can view, create, modify, and delete their application resources in the subnets that are shared with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vpc-peering&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPC Peering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enables you to privately route traffic between two VPCs. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they were on the same network. You can create VPC peering connection between your own VPCs with a VPC in another AWS accounts, or between regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you set up the VPC peering connection, you create rules in your route table to allow the VPCs to communicate with each other. VPC peering has some restrictions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IP Spaces cannot overlap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transitive peering (chaining VPC peering) is not supported&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only have one peering resource between the same two VPCs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aws-direct-connect&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Direct Connect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enables your to establish a dedicated private connection between your network and one of the direct connect locations. The private connection can increase bandwidth, throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based or VPN connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vpc-endpoints&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPC Endpoints&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A virtual device that enables you to privately connect a VPC to supported AWS services. There are two types of endpoints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gateway endpoints that you specify as a target for a route in your route table to either S3 or DynamoDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink. PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and on-premises applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;aws-transit-gateway&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AWS Transit Gateway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A network transit hub that is used to interconnect virtual private clouds, on-premises networks, VPCs, Direct Connect gateways, and VPN connections to a transit gateway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topology of a Transit Gateway is a hub and spoke which reduces the number of connections required, and the complexity to implement and maintain it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;security-groups&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act at the instance level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security groups have rules that control inbound and outbound instance traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default security groups deny all inbound traffic and allow all outbound traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security groups are stateful - return traffic is automatically allowed, regardless of rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All rules are evaluated before the decision to allow traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;network-access-control-lists-acls&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Access Control Lists (ACLs)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act at the subnet level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Default network ACLs allow all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network ACLs are stateless - return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customn network ACLs deny all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can specify both allow and deny rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rules are evaluated in number order, starting with the lowest number&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

) into numeric IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to connect to each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully compliant with IPv4 and IPv6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS and also outside of AWS&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple routing – Use in single-server environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weighted round robin routing – Assign weights to resource record sets to specify the frequency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latency routing – Help improve your global applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geolocation routing – Route traffic based on location of your users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geoproximity routing – Route traffic based on location of your resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failover routing – Fail over to a backup site if your primary site becomes unreachable. Improve the availability of your applications that run on AWS by:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configuring backup and failover scenarios for your own applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enabling highly available multi-region architectures on AWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating health checks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multivalue answer routing – Respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;launching-an-ec2-instance&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launching an EC2 Instance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the nine key decisions to make when you create an EC2 instance by using the AWS Management Console Launch Instance Wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is a template that is used to create an EC2 instance (a virtual machine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contains a Windows or Linux operating system and often has some software pre-installed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AMI choices:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quick Start – Linux and Windows AMIs that are provided by AWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My AMIs – Any AMIs that you created&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AWS Marketplace – Pre-configured templates from third parties&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community AMIs – AMIs shared by others; use at your own risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select an Instance Type
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimized to fit different use cases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The instance type that you choose determines
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory (RAM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Processing power (CPU)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disk space and disk type (Storage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instance type categories
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute optimized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory optimized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage optimized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accelerated computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instance types offer family, generation, and size (Example - &lt;code&gt;t3.large&lt;/code&gt;: Family - &lt;code&gt;T&lt;/code&gt;, Generation - &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;, Size - &lt;code&gt;large&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking Features
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The network bandwidth (Gbps) varies by instance type.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To maximize networking and bandwidth performance of your instance type enable enhanced networking and if you have interdependent instances, launch them into a cluster placement group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhanced networking types are supported on most instance types. Enhanced networking types:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elastic Network Adapter (ENA): Supports network speeds of up to 100 Gbps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel 82599 Virtual Function interface: Supports network speeds of up to 10 Gbps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify Network Settings
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where should the instance be deployed? Identify the VPC and optionally the subnet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should a public IP addressbe automatically assigned?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can have multiple networks, such as different ones for development, testing and production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attach IAM Role (optional)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will software on the EC2 instance need to interact with other AWS services? If yes, attach an appropriate IAM Role. IAM Roles can be attached at any time, not just launch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that is attached to an EC2 instance is kept in an instance profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User Data Script (optional)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify a user data script at instance launch. Use user data scripts to customize the runtime environment of your instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Script executes the first time the instance starts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify Storage
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure the root volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attach additional storage volumes(optional). For each volume, specify:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disk Size (in GB)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume type (SSDs or HDDs)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the volume will be deleted when the instance is terminated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If encryption should be used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage Options:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) –
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Durable, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block-level_storage&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;block-level storage&lt;/a&gt;
 volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can stop the instance and start it again, and the data will still be there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon EC2 Instance Store
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage is provided on disks that are attached to the host computer where the EC2 instance is running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the instance stops, data stored here is deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other options for storage (not for the root volume)
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mount an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) file system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect to Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Tags
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consists of a key and an optional value.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tagging is how you can attach metadata to an EC2 instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potential benefits: Filtering, automation, cost allocation, and access control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security Group Settings
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A security group is a set of firewall rules that control traffic to the instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you launch an instance, you associate one or more security groups with it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create rules that specify the source, which ports that network communications can use and the protocol (TPC, UDP, ICMP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify the rules for a security group at any time; the new rules are automatically applied to all instances that are associated with the security group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify or Create the Key Pair
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At instance launch, you specify an existing key pair or create a new key pair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A key pair consists of a public key that AWS stores and a private key file that you store&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It enables secure connections to the instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Windows AMIs – Use the private key to obtain the administrator password that you need to log in to your instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Linux AMIs – Use the private key to use SSH to securely connect to your instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;miscellaneous&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider using an Elastic IP Address if you require a persistent public IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instance metadata can be viewed in browser or a terminal window, and can be used to configure or manage a running instance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon CloudWatch can be used to monitor an EC2 instance to provide near-real-time metrics, charts, and 15 months of historical data. CloudWatch has basic monitoring (no additional cost) or detailed monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On-Demand Instances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pay by the hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No long-term commitments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eligible for the AWS Free Tier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedicated Hosts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedicated Instances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instances that run in a VPC on hardware that is dedicated to a single customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot Instances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instances run as long as they are available and your bid is above the Spot Instance price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can be interrupted by AWS with a 2-minute notification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interruption options include terminated, stopped or hibernated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prices can be significantly less expensive compared to On-Demand
Instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good choice when you have flexibility in when your applications can run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserved Instances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full, partial, or no upfront payment for instance you reserve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discount on hourly charge for that instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-year or 3-year term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheduled Reserved Instances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Purchase a capacity reservation that is always available on a recurring schedule you specify&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-year term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per second billing available for On-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances that run Amazon Linux or Ubuntu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;four-pillars-of-cost-optimization&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Pillars of Cost Optimization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right Size&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provision instances to match the need - CPU, memory, storage, and network throughput&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to dowsize as needed - How idle are instances? When?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best practice: Right size, then reserve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase Elasticity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stop or hibernate Amazon EBS-backed instances that are not actively in use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use automatic scaling to match needs based on usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimal Pricing Model&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage the right pricing model for your use case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize and combine purchase types
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examples: Use On-Demand Instance and Spot Instances for variable workloads, use Reserved Instances for predictable workloads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider serverless solutions (AWS Lambda)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimize Storage Choices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduce costs while maintaining storage performance and availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resize EBS volumes and change EBS volume types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete EBS snapshots that are no longer needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the most appropriate destination for specific types of data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost optimization is an ongoing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define and enforce cost allocation tagging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define metrics, set targets, and review regularly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage teams to architect for cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assign the responsibility of optimization to an individual or to a team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;container-basics&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Container Basics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers are a method of operating system virtualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeatable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-contained execution environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software runs the same in different environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster to launch and stop or terminate than virtual machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker is a software platform that enables you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Containers are created from a template called an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;amazon-elastic-container-service-ecs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A highly scalable, fast, container management service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key benefits
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orchestrates the execution of Docker containers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintains and scales the fleet of nodes that run your containers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Removes the complexity of standing up the infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrated with features that are familiar to Amazon EC2 service users
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Elastic Load Balancing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon EC2 security groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon EBS volumes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IAM roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to manage the Amazon ECS cluster that runs the containers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If yes, create an Amazon ECS cluster backed by Amazon EC2 (provides more granular control over infrastructure)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If no, create an Amazon ECS cluster backed by AWS Fargate (easier to maintain, focus on your applications)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-eks&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is Kubernetes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes is open source software for container orchestration
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy and manage containerized applicationsat scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The same toolset can be used on premises and in the cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complements Docker
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Docker enables you to run multiple containers on a single OS host&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kubernetes orchestrates multiple Docker hosts (nodes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automates container provisioning, networking, load distribution and scaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enables you to run Kubernetes on AWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certified Kubernetes conformant (supports easy migration)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports Linux and Windows containers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatible with Kubernetes community tools and supports popular Kubernetes add-ons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Amazon EKS to manage clusters of Amazon EC2 compute instances and run containers that are orchestrated by Kubernetes on those instances&lt;/li&gt;

 (EBS) is an easy to use, high performance &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_%28data_storage%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;block storage&lt;/a&gt;
 service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for both throughput and transaction intensive workloads at any scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;strong&gt;block storage&lt;/strong&gt;, files are split into evenly sized blocks of data, each with its own address but with no additional information (metadata) to provide more context for what that block of data is. &lt;strong&gt;Object storage&lt;/strong&gt;, by contrast, doesn’t split files up into raw blocks of data. Instead, entire clumps of data are stored in, yes, an object that contains the data, metadata, and the unique identifier. With block storage you can update a single block without having to update the entire file like in object storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon EBS enables you to create individual storage volumes and attach them to an Amazon EC2 instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offers block-level storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HDD and SSD available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volumes are automatically replicated within its Availability Zone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be backed up automatically to Amazon S3 through snapshots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designed for resiliency - Annual Failure Rate (AFR) is between 0.1% and 1%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses include:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boot volumes and storage for (Amazon EC2) instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data storage with a file system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database hosts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enterprise applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point-in-time images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recreate a new volume at any time&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon EBS volumes persist independently from the instance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All volume types are charged by the amount that is provisioned per month.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Purpose SSD: Charged by the amount that you provision in GB per month until storage is released&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magnetic: Charged by the number of requests to the volum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisioned IOPS SSD: Charged by the amount that you provision in IOPS (multiplied by the percentage of days that you provision for the month).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data transfer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1-amazon-relational-database-service-rds&#34;&gt;Section 1: Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups. RDS provides you with six familiar database engines to choose from: Amazon Aurora, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;managed-vs-unmanaged-service&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managed vs Unmanaged Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unmanaged Challenges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server maintenance and energy footprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software installation and patches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database backups and high availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limits on scalability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating system (OS) installation and patches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RDS is a managed service that sets up and operates a relational database in the cloud. AWS Manages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OS installation and patches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database software installation and patches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database backups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scaling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power and racking and stacking servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rds-features&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RDS Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The database instance is the basic building block of Amazon RDS. The DB instance is an isolated database environment that can contain multiple user created databases. When setting up the database, you pick an instance class and the type of storage you need for your database. You also need to specify which database engine to run: MySQL, Amazon Aurora, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, or Oracle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon RDS allows you to configure your DB instance for high availability with a Multi-AZ (availability zone) deployment. When you configure a Multi-AZ deployment, RDS automatically generates a standby copy of the database instance in another availability zone within the same VPC. After seeding the database copy, transactions are synchronously replicated to the standby copy. If the main database instance fails in a Multi-AZ deployment, RDS automatically brings the standby database instance online as the new main instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RDS also supports the creation of read replicas. Updates that are made to the source database instance are asynchronously copied to the read replica instance. You can reduce the load on your source DB instance by routing read queries from your applications to the read replica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cost-and-usage-of-rds&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost and Usage of RDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;when-to-use-rds&#34;&gt;When to use RDS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use when you require:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex transactions or complex queries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medium to high query or write rate – Up to 30,000 IOPS (15,000 reads + 15,000 writes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No more than a single worker node or shard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High durability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not use when:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Massive read/write rates (for example, 150,000 write/second)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharding due to high data size or throughput demands&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple GET or PUT requests and queries that a NoSQL database can handle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relational database management system (RDBMS) customization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;billing&#34;&gt;Billing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple factors influence the cost of RDS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clock hour billing - resources incur charges when running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database characteristics effect cost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DB Purchase Type
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-Demand Instances - Compute capacity by the hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reserved Instances - Low, one-time, upfront payment for database instances that are reserved with a 1-year or 3-year term&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of DB instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provisioned storage
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No charge - Backup storage of up to 100 percent of database storage for an active database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charge (GB/month) - Backup storage for terminated DB instances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional Storage - Charge (GB/Month) for backup storage in addition to the provisioned storage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of Requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deployment type — Storage and I/0 charges vary, depending on whether you deploy to a single availability zone or multiple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data transfer – No charge for inbound, tiered charges for outbound&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Indicate how to distribute traffic across Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances by using Elastic Load Balancing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify how Amazon CloudWatch enables you to monitor AWS resources and applications in real time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain how Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches and releases servers in response to workload changes&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-1-elastic-load-balancing&#34;&gt;Section 1: Elastic Load Balancing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elastic Load Balancing distributes incoming application or network traffic across multiple targets in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. It also scales your load balancer as traffic to your application changes over time. Monitoring is done via Amazon CloudWatch, access logs, and AWS CloudTrail logs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;types-of-load-balancers&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of Load Balancers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Application Load Balancer&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Network Load Balancer&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Classic Load Balancer (Previous Generation)&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Load balancing of TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic where extreme performance is required&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Load balancing of HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, and SSL traffic&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;- Routes traffic to targets based on content of request &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Provides advanced request routing to targeted at the delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and containers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;- Routes traffic to targets based on IP protocol data &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Can handle millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; - Optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Load balancing across multiple EC2 instances&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Operates at the application layer (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;OSI model&lt;/a&gt;
 layer 7)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Operate at the transport layer (OSI model layer 4)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Operates at both the application and transport layers&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, you register targets in target groups, and route traffic to the target groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With Classic Load Balancers, you register instances with the load balancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alarms:&lt;/strong&gt; Send notifications to an Amazon SNS topic and perform Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling or Amazon EC2 actions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create alarms based on:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Static threshold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anomaly detection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metric math expression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specify:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metric&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Period&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conditions&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Provides a simple, powerful user interface that enables you to build scaling plans for resources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps you maintain application availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enables you to automatically add or remove EC2 instances according to conditions that you define&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Arch Linux Post Installation</title>
      <link>/post/arch-linux/02-arch-linux-base-install/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 09:45:37 +0302</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/arch-linux/02-arch-linux-base-install/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In post installation we will be using a lot of &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m not responsible if you broke your newly installed system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;connect-to-the-internet&#34;&gt;Connect to the internet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be downloading stuff so we need an internet connection! So set-up your connection first!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;check-for-updates&#34;&gt;Check for Updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s recommended to check for updates first before installing anything so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -Syu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;display-server-and-protocol&#34;&gt;Display Server and Protocol&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to install a display server, a protocol or both. Normally, your desktop environment or window manager of choice will automatically install these as a dependency. But for this guide&amp;rsquo;s sake we will install &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xrdb xorg-xinit xorg-xrandr xorg-xev xorg-xdpyinfo xorg-xprop
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to use a window manager like &lt;code&gt;awesome&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bspwm&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;i3&lt;/code&gt;, you should install X. While if you&amp;rsquo;re planning to use &lt;code&gt;sway&lt;/code&gt;, then wayland it is. If &lt;code&gt;GNOME&lt;/code&gt;, you can install both. Again, your environment of choice will automatically install these as its dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;video-drivers&#34;&gt;Video Drivers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing the graphical server, we need to install the video drivers. I&amp;rsquo;m only using an integrated &lt;code&gt;AMD&lt;/code&gt; graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For AMD graphics. Read the arch wiki on &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ATI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;ATI&lt;/a&gt;
 before procedding any futher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S xf86-video-ati vulkan-icd-loader libvdpau-va-gl  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Intel Graphics. Read the arch wiki on &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Intel_graphics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S xf86-video-intel vulkan-intel vulkan-icd-loader libva-intel-driver
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add your (kernel) graphics driver to your initramfs. For example, if using &lt;code&gt;ati&lt;/code&gt; add &lt;code&gt;radeon&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;vim /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then add &lt;code&gt;radeon&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;MODULES&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;MODULES=(radeon ...)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generate the mkinitcpio file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkinitcpio -p linux-lts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;audio-drivers&#34;&gt;Audio Drivers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S alsa-utils alsa-plugins alsa-firmware
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-system-tools&#34;&gt;File System Tools&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File system tools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S unrar unzip p7zip unarchiver gvfs-mtp libmtp ntfs-3g android-udev mtpfs xdg-user-dirs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;xdg-user-dirs&lt;/code&gt; is a tool to help manage &amp;ldquo;well known&amp;rdquo; user directories like the desktop folder and the music folder. This will be automatically run on your next log in. Though you can manually generate XDG user directories by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;xdg-user-dirs-update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;git&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;rsquo;t include &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; on &lt;code&gt;pacstrap&lt;/code&gt; earlier, it&amp;rsquo;s time to install it now. This tool will come in handy later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;aur-helper&#34;&gt;AUR Helper&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;later&amp;rdquo; is now, old man. We will now install an AUR helper, &lt;code&gt;yay&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone &lt;code&gt;yay&lt;/code&gt; from the AUR using &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay/
makepkg -sri
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;missing-kernel-modules&#34;&gt;Missing Kernel Modules&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you noticed, there&amp;rsquo;s a warning message while running &lt;code&gt;mkinitcpio -p linux&lt;/code&gt;, fix this by installing these firmwares:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yay -S wd719x-firmware aic94xx-firmware --removemake --noconfirm
mkinitcpio -p linux-lts 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;desktop-environment-and-window-manager&#34;&gt;Desktop Environment and Window Manager&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install your preferred desktop environment or window manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binary Space Partitioning Window Manager(bspwm)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I install bspwm together with sxhkd that serves as the X hot key daemon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S bspwm sxhkd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picom as the compositor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S picom
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rofi as the application launcher:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S rofi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;terminal-emulator&#34;&gt;Terminal Emulator&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing an environment, we need a terminal emulator. Every linux user&amp;rsquo;s first partner. Note that we&amp;rsquo;re still on the &lt;code&gt;TTY&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install your preferred terminal emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an &lt;code&gt;alacritty&lt;/code&gt; guy. In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll include a guide to set-up &lt;code&gt;alacritty&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alacritty&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always prefer to setup alacritty together with alacritty-themes. This enables me to change up alacritty&amp;rsquo;s themes from time to time:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yay -S alacritty alacritty-themes
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;gtk&#34;&gt;GTK&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GTK, or the GIMP Toolkit, is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not yet installed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S gtk3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install GTK engines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S gtk-engine-murrine gtk-engines gnome-theme-extra
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-managers&#34;&gt;File Managers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer to use a light-weight file manager such as &lt;code&gt;thunar&lt;/code&gt; for the graphical file manager and &lt;code&gt;nnn&lt;/code&gt; for the CLI file manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S thunar nnn
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;cli-based-text-editor&#34;&gt;CLI-based Text Editor&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Nvchad&amp;rsquo; is my prefered choice for an IDE. Read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nvchad.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;NVchad&lt;/a&gt;
 documentation before installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure you have installed &lt;code&gt;neovim&lt;/code&gt; before you can install Nvchad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S neovim
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;gui-based-text-editors&#34;&gt;GUI-based Text Editors&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; is my text editor of choice, but sublime Text 3 is my go-to GUI text editor as it&amp;rsquo;s lighter than the &lt;del&gt;bloated&lt;/del&gt; chromium-based counterparts like &lt;code&gt;atom&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;vscode&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yay -S sublime-text-dev
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that Sublime is not &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; and needs a license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;web-browsers&#34;&gt;Web browsers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Brave-browser&lt;/code&gt; is my trusted web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yay -S brave-bin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;reboot-then-login&#34;&gt;Reboot then Login&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system&amp;rsquo;s fully functional! You can now login to you system with all the configuration we&amp;rsquo;ve done so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;reboot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;extras&#34;&gt;Extras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;power-management-for-laptops&#34;&gt;Power Management for Laptops&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TLP brings you the benefits of advanced power management for Linux without the need to understand every technical detail. &lt;strong&gt;This is for laptops.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install and enable it now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S tlp
systemctl enable --now tlp.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;code&gt;upower&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;acpid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;acpi_call&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S acpid acpi_call upower
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enable acpid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;systemctl enable acpid.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;fonts&#34;&gt;Fonts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improve fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install these fonts. Inter will be my system font no matter what the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S ttf-dejavu ttf-liberation noto-fonts noto-fonts-emoji ttf-roboto ttf-jetbrains-mono
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;yay -S ttf-monaco
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional fonts to support Asian characters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo pacman -S noto-fonts-cjk noto-fonts-extra
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enable font presets by creating symbolic links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/70-no-bitmaps.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d
ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/10-sub-pixel-rgb.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d
ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/11-lcdfilter-default.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above will disable embedded bitmap for all fonts, enable sub-pixel RGB rendering, and enable the LCD filter which is designed to reduce colour fringing when subpixel rendering is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For font consistency, all applications should be set to use the &lt;code&gt;serif&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sans-serif&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;monospace&lt;/code&gt; aliases, which are mapped to particular fonts by fontconfig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create &lt;code&gt;/etc/fonts/local.conf&lt;/code&gt;, then add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-xml&#34; data-lang=&#34;xml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;#34;1.0&amp;#34;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Arch Linux Base Installation</title>
      <link>/post/arch-linux/01-arch-linux-base-install/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 09:45:37 +0303</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/arch-linux/01-arch-linux-base-install/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my personal guide. I recommend that you read the official &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;
. The purpose of this guide is to speed up my personal install of &lt;code&gt;Archlinux&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-archlinux&#34;&gt;Why Archlinux&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Archlinux&lt;/code&gt; distribution gives you the freedom to &lt;code&gt;do it yourself&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt; that your kernel and initramfs are on the root file system, recovery after a crash may prove troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are many ways you can layout your partitions, I will focus on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type of hardware (&lt;em&gt;BIOS&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bootloader (&lt;em&gt;GRUB&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use my laptop for technical work, so the order,the type and the size of partitions matter for my use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am just a speed enthusiast, I like High Performance Computing and why not try to learn by doing it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;MAIN&lt;/strong&gt; reason of installing vanilla linux(&lt;code&gt;Archlinux&lt;/code&gt;) are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Bloatware&lt;/strong&gt; - Imagine &lt;code&gt;4GB&lt;/code&gt; image for Windows, &lt;code&gt;2GB+&lt;/code&gt; for Fedora or Ubuntu but Arch Linux approx. &lt;code&gt;700MB&lt;/code&gt;. Softwares preinstalled that you will never use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance &amp;amp; Security&lt;/strong&gt; - Other distributions contain spyware you didn&amp;rsquo;t install and are working in the background slowing your machine and making you quite uncomfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning&lt;/strong&gt; - A better understanding of Linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimalism&lt;/strong&gt; - Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-installation&#34;&gt;Pre-installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before installing, make sure to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt;
. It is advisable to read that instead. I wrote this guide for myself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquire an installation image from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.archlinux.org/download&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verify signature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare an installation medium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boot the live environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic understanding of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openvim.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-an-installation-medium&#34;&gt;Create an Installation Medium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we need to create an installation medium to boot from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Linux using the &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dd if=path_to_arch_iso of=/dev/sd* status=progress
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; CLI utility for converting and copying files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; the input file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;of&lt;/code&gt; the output file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; see periodic transfer statistics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;installation-medium-boot&#34;&gt;Installation Medium Boot&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;change-font-settings&#34;&gt;Change Font Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the terminal font is too small, which can happen if you have a high resolution display, then execute the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the font size to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;setfont lat4a-19 -m 8859-2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;connect-to-the-internet&#34;&gt;Connect to the internet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to make sure that we are connected to the internet to be able to install Arch Linux &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt; packages. Let’s see the names of our interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ip addr
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1: lo: &amp;lt;LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP&amp;gt; mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
		link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
2: eno1: &amp;lt;NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP&amp;gt; mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
		link/ether 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
3: wlo1: &amp;lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&amp;gt; mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP mode DORMANT group default qlen 1000
		link/ether 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff permaddr 00:00:00:00:00:00
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;eno1&lt;/code&gt; is the wired interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;wlo1&lt;/code&gt; is the wireless interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wired-connection&#34;&gt;Wired Connection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are on a wired connection, you can enable your wired interface by systemctl start &lt;code&gt;dhcpcd@&amp;lt;interface&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;systemctl start dhcpcd@eno1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;wireless-connection&#34;&gt;Wireless Connection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are on a laptop, you can connect to a wireless access point using &lt;code&gt;iwctl&lt;/code&gt; command from &lt;code&gt;iwd&lt;/code&gt;. Note that it&amp;rsquo;s already enabled by default. Also make sure the wireless card is not blocked with &lt;code&gt;rfkill&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show current status:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rfkill list
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the card is hard-blocked, use the hardware button (switch) to unblock it. If the card is not hard-blocked but soft-blocked, use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rfkill unblock wifi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scan for network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iwctl station wlo1 scan
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get the list of scanned networks by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iwctl station wlo1 get-networks
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connect to your network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;iwctl -P &amp;#34;PASSPHRASE&amp;#34; station wlo1 connect &amp;#34;NETWORKNAME&amp;#34;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ping the Goggle DNS servers to make sure we are online:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ping -c 5 8.8.8.8
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-c 5&lt;/code&gt;    number of times to ping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;8.8.8.8&lt;/code&gt; Google DNS server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you receive Unknown host or Destination host unreachable response, means you are not online yet. Review your network configuration and redo the steps above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update-the-system-clock&#34;&gt;Update the system clock&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;timedatectl&lt;/code&gt; to ensure the system clock is accurate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;timedatectl set-ntp true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;To check the service status, use &lt;code&gt;timedatectl status&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;partition-the-disks&#34;&gt;Partition the disks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When recognized by the live system, disks are assigned to a block device such as &lt;code&gt;/dev/sda&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/dev/nvme0n1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;/dev/mmcblk0&lt;/code&gt;. To identify these devices, use lsblk or fdisk.  The most common main drive is &lt;code&gt;sda&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lsblk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results ending in &lt;code&gt;rom&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;airoot&lt;/code&gt; may be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll create a one type of partition for the drive. A normal installation that is unencrypted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unencrypted-filesystem&#34;&gt;Unencrypted filesystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE THE FOLLOWING STEPS WILL COMPLETELY FORMAT YOUR DISK NODES. ENSURE YOU&amp;rsquo;VE READ THE WIKI AND UNDERSTAND THE STEPS BELOW BEFORE EXECUTION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let’s clean up our main drive to create new partitions for our installation. And yeah, in this guide, we will use &lt;code&gt;/dev/sda&lt;/code&gt; as our disk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fdisk /dev/sda 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;p&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to list all partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we should be presented with our main drive showing the partition number, partition size, partition type, and partition name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;d&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;delete a partition&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input the number of the partition you want deleted. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;1&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; or &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;w&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to write changes to the disk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this will &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;format&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; your entire drive so your data will be gone. &lt;strong&gt;THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Press &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;p&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to list all partitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we should be presented with our main drive showing the partition number, partition size, partition type, and partition name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the &lt;code&gt;swap&lt;/code&gt; partition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;n&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to create a new partition for the swap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;p&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to select &lt;code&gt;primary&lt;/code&gt; partition for the swap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just hit enter to select the default option for the first sector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the last sector I always assign mine to &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;+8G&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;t&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to change the partition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;82&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to change partition to &lt;code&gt;Linux swap / Solaris&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;1.5X RAM&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; partition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Hit enter to select the default option for the first sector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit enter to select last sector and input your size for the root partition. &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;+150G&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; partition&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Hit enter again to use the remainder of the disk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;t&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to change the partition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;83&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; to change partition to &lt;code&gt;Linux&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly write changes to disk &lt;code&gt;/dev/sda&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;lsblk

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;space_cache=v2&lt;/code&gt; Options to control the free space cache. The free space cache greatly improves performance when reading block group free space into memory.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s go ahead and install &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;linux-firmware&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;base-devel&lt;/code&gt; packages into our system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure you have installed &lt;code&gt;reflector&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;archlinux-keyring&lt;/code&gt; before procedding with pacstrap installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S reflector archlinux-keyring
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware vim amd-ucode btrfs-progs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pacstrap will install the packages mentioned above on a newly made root partition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt;: Base linux system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt;: Latest linux kernel and modules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;linux-firmware&lt;/code&gt;: Firmware files for linux.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;: Terminal based text editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;intel-ucode&lt;/code&gt;: Microcode update files for Intel CPUs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;amd-ucode&lt;/code&gt;: Microde update files for AMD CPUs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;btrfs-progress&lt;/code&gt;: Brtfs filesystem utilites.
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other kernel available for installation are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;linux-lts&lt;/code&gt;: Long term support of the Linux Kernel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;linux-zen&lt;/code&gt;: For the performance driven users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;linux-hardened&lt;/code&gt;: For the security concerned users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users interested in installing other kernels on the system read this &lt;a href=&#34;https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/btrfs-man5.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;post&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; package does not include all tools from the live installation, so installing other packages may be necessary for a fully functional base system. In particular, consider installing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;userspace utilities for the management of file systems that will be used on the system,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ntfs-3g&lt;/code&gt;: NTFS filesystem driver and utilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;unrar&lt;/code&gt;: The RAR uncompression program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;unzip&lt;/code&gt;: For extracting and viewing files in &lt;code&gt;.zip&lt;/code&gt; archives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;p7zip&lt;/code&gt;: Command-line file archiver with high compression ratio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;unarchiver&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;unar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;lsar&lt;/code&gt;: Objective-C tools for uncompressing archive files&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;gvfs-mtp&lt;/code&gt;: Virtual filesystem implementation for &lt;code&gt;GIO&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;MTP&lt;/code&gt; backend; Android, media player)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;libmtp&lt;/code&gt;: Library implementation of the Media Transfer Protocol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;android-udev&lt;/code&gt;: Udev rules to connect Android devices to your linux box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mtpfs&lt;/code&gt;: A FUSE filesystem that supports reading and writing from any MTP devic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;xdg-user-dirs&lt;/code&gt;: Manage user directories like &lt;code&gt;~/Desktop&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;~/Music&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;software necessary for networking,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;packages for accessing documentation in man and info pages,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;man-db&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;man-pages&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and more useful tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;: the fast distributed version control system&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools will be useful later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;generating-the-fstab&#34;&gt;Generating the fstab&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;genfstab -U /mnt &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /mnt/etc/fstab
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the resulting &lt;code&gt;/mnt/etc/fstab&lt;/code&gt; file, and edit it in case of errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cat /mnt/etc/fstab
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;chroot&#34;&gt;Chroot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, change root into the newly installed system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;time-zone&#34;&gt;Time zone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A selection of timezones can be found under &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/zoneinfo/&lt;/code&gt;. Since I am in the Kenya, I will be using &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/zoneinfo/Africa/Nairobi&lt;/code&gt;. Select the appropriate timezone for your country:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a symolic link to &lt;code&gt;etc/localtime&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Africa/Nairobi /etc/localtime
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;hwclock&lt;/code&gt; to generate &lt;code&gt;/etc/adjtime&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hwclock --systohc
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This command assumes the hardware clock is set to UTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;localization&#34;&gt;Localization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;locale&lt;/code&gt; defines which language the system uses, and other regional considerations such as currency denomination, numerology, and character sets. Possible values are listed in &lt;code&gt;/etc/locale.gen&lt;/code&gt;. Uncomment &lt;code&gt;en_US.UTF-8&lt;/code&gt;, as well as other needed localisations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;vim /etc/locale.gen
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncomment&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;/etc/locale.gen&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; the file, and generate them with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or use the command to uncomment the line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sed -i `178s` /etc/locale.gen
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;generate the &lt;code&gt;locale.gen&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;locale-gen
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create the &lt;code&gt;locale.conf&lt;/code&gt; file, and set the LANG variable accordingly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo &amp;#34;LANG=en_US.UTF-8&amp;#34; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /etc/locale.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you set the keyboard layout earlier, make the changes persistent in &lt;code&gt;vconsole.conf&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo &amp;#34;KEYMAP=us&amp;#34; &amp;gt; /etc/vconsole.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;network-configuration&#34;&gt;Network configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the hostname file. In this guide I&amp;rsquo;ll just use &lt;code&gt;MYHOSTNAME&lt;/code&gt; as hostname. Hostname is the host name of the host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo &amp;#34;MYHOSTNAME&amp;#34; &amp;gt; /etc/hostname
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/code&gt; to add matching entries to &lt;code&gt;hosts&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1    localhost  
::1          localhost  
127.0.1.1    MYHOSTNAME.localdomain	  MYHOSTNAME
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the system has a permanent IP address, it should be used instead of &lt;code&gt;127.0.1.1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-btrfs-mofule-to-mkinitcpio&#34;&gt;Adding btrfs mofule to mkinitcpio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we create the formatted the system using btrfs, we need to add the &lt;code&gt;btrfs&lt;/code&gt; module to the kernel inorder to initalized it at boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit the mkinitcpio configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;vim /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;btrfs&lt;/code&gt; to the modules section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;MODULES=(btrfs)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;unencrypted-filesystem-3&#34;&gt;Unencrypted filesystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generate the &lt;code&gt;mkinitcpio&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkinitcpio -p linux
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-repositories---multilib-and-aur&#34;&gt;Adding Repositories - multilib and AUR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enable multilib and AUR repositories in &lt;code&gt;/etc/pacman.conf&lt;/code&gt;. Open it with your editor of choice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adding-multilib-repository&#34;&gt;Adding multilib repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncomment &lt;code&gt;multilib&lt;/code&gt; (remove # from the beginning of the lines). It should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[multilib]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;adding-the-aur-repository&#34;&gt;Adding the AUR repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the following lines at the end of your &lt;code&gt;/etc/pacman.conf&lt;/code&gt; to enable the AUR repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[archlinuxfr]
SigLevel = Never
Server = http://repo.archlinux.fr/$arch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;pacman-easter-eggs&#34;&gt;Pacman easter eggs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can enable the &amp;ldquo;easter-eggs&amp;rdquo; in &lt;code&gt;pacman&lt;/code&gt;, the package manager of archlinux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code&gt;/etc/pacman.conf&lt;/code&gt;, then find &lt;code&gt;# Misc options&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add colors to &lt;code&gt;pacman&lt;/code&gt;, uncomment &lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt;. To add the &amp;ldquo;Pac-Man&amp;rdquo; animation to &lt;code&gt;pacman&lt;/code&gt; add the following command: &lt;code&gt;ILoveCandy&lt;/code&gt; under the &lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt; string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Color
ILoveCandy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-repositories-and-packages&#34;&gt;Update repositories and packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To check if you successfully added the repositories and enable the easter-eggs, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -Syu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If updating returns an error, open the &lt;code&gt;pacman.conf&lt;/code&gt; again and check for human errors. Yes, you f&amp;rsquo;ed up big time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;install-packages&#34;&gt;Install packages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pacman -S grub efibootmgr os-prober ntfs-3g \
networkmanager network-manager-applet wireless_tools \
wpa_supplicant dialog mtools dosfstools base-devel \
linux-headers alsa-utils openssh 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;installing-grub&#34;&gt;Installing GRUB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing grub on a legacy system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing grub on a UEFI system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/ --bootloader-id=GRUB
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genertate the configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;root-password&#34;&gt;Root password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; password:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;passwd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter your password twice to set the root password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-a-user-account&#34;&gt;Add a user account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a new user account. In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;ll just use &lt;code&gt;MYUSERNAME&lt;/code&gt; as the username of the new user aside from &lt;code&gt;root&lt;/code&gt; account. Of course, change the example username with your own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;useradd -m -g users -G wheel,storage,power,video,audio,rfkill,input -s /bin/bash MYUSERNAME
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will create a new user and its &lt;code&gt;home&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the password of user &lt;code&gt;MYUSERNAME&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;passwd MYUSERNAME
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-the-new-user-to-sudoers&#34;&gt;Add the new user to sudoers:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a root privilege in the future by using the &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; command, you should grant one yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;EDITOR=vim visudo
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncomment the line (Remove #):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;enable-internet-connection-for-the-next-boot&#34;&gt;Enable internet connection for the next boot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable the network daemons on your next reboot, you need to enable &lt;code&gt;dhcpcd.service&lt;/code&gt; for wired connection and &lt;code&gt;iwd.service&lt;/code&gt; for a wireless one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;systemctl enable dhcpcd iwd
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;exit-chroot-and-reboot&#34;&gt;Exit chroot and reboot:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exit the chroot environment by typing &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unmount all partitions with the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;umount -R /mnt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;code&gt;reboot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;reboot
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>
